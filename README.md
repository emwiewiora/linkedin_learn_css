# linkedin_learn_css
This is my follow along project for LinkedIn Learning - CSS Essential Training

I have been using CSS for a long time, but I learned it as needed.  This caused me to miss a lot of details and not get a full understanding of what i was doing. It was nice to walk through this course and put all the pieces together and add a deeper level of understanding.

Thank you Christina Truong for putting together a great course.
Thank you LinkedIn Learning for providing more greate content.
